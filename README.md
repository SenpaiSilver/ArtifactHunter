ArtifactHunter
==============

This game is based on S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s universe.

You are a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. looking for artifacts in the Zone. The thing is that you will encounter anomalies that will kill while you hunt for artifacts.

This game is based on the Voltorbe minigame from Pokemon Soul Silver and Heart Gold. The rules are simple: avoid anomalies.

Each line and colomn has the number of anomalies present to help you.

A live version of the game is hosted [here](http://artifacthunter.senpaisilver.com/).
